## Multivariate Extreme Value distributions

R-package to perform simulations from multivariate extreme value models. The package also includes
some routine functions for univariate analysis, notably threshold selection diagnostics, optimization
for the generalized Pareto distribution, bias-correction and tangent exponential model approximations,
non-parametric spectral measure estimation using empirical likelihood methods, etc.


To install from Github, use 

```R
