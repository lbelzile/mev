An **R** package to extreme value analysis. The package includes routine functions for univariate analyses, notably threshold selection diagnostics, optimization, bias-correction and tangent exponential model approximations, non-parametric spectral measure estimation using empirical likelihood methods, etc. The main focus is on simulation algorithms for multivariate models and user-provided methodologies.


To install from Github, use

```R
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/mev")
