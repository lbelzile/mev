#' Eskdalemuir Observatory Daily Rainfall
#'
#' This dataset contains exceedances of 30mm for daily
#' cumulated rainfall observations over the period 1970-1986.
#' These data were aggregated from hourly series.
#'
#' The station is one of the rainiest of the whole UK, with an average 1554m of cumulated rainfall per year.
#' The data consisted of 6209 daily observations, of which 4409 were non-zero.
#' Only the 93 largest observations are provided.

#' Venice Sea Levels
#'
#' The \code{venice} data contains the 10 largest yearly sea levels (in cm)
#' from 1887 until 2017. Only the yearly maximum is available for 1922
#' and the six largest observations for 1936.
#'
#' @format a data frame with 131 rows and 11 columns containing the year of the measurement (first column)
#' and ordered 10-largest yearly observations, reported in decreasing order from largest (\code{r1}) to smallest (\code{r10}).
#'
#' @note Smith (1986) notes that the annual maxima seems to fluctuate around a constant sea level
#' up to 1930 or so, after which there is potential linear trend. Records of threshold exceedances above
#' 80 cm (reported on the website) indicate that observations are temporally clustered.
#'
#' The observations from 1931 until 1981 can be found in
#' Table 1 in Smith (1986), who reported data from Pirazzoli (1982).
#' The values from 1983 until 2017 were extracted by Anthony Davison from the City
#' of Venice website (accessed October 2018).
#' and are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. The Venice City website indicates
#' that later measurements were recorded by an instrument located in Punta Salute.
