mev v.1.14 
==============
New: 
* four new families of max-stable models (pairwise beta, pairwise exponential, weighted Dirichlet and weighted exponential) for rmev, following Ballani and Schlather (2011)
* function `fit.gpd` and `fit.gev` now accept fixed parameters

* 'rparp' now has a hard bound to ensure the vector of simulated vectors fits in memory.
* Change to Grimshaw routine to ensure shape not less than -1, constrained optimization method
* Information matrix, score for GEV now interpolated in a neighborhood of zero to preserve continuity and avoid numerical overflow.
* Information matrix of GEV: scale factor off. All scores and information matrix have been checked and limits as xi -> 0  implemented.
* ext.index number of exceedances off by one, causing Inf in weight vector for lm (thanks to @MCristinaMiranda). Warnings now silenced by default.

Changes:
* coordinates for rmev, rparp, etc. now use `coord` instead of `loc` to avoid confusion with location parameter in `rgparp`
* Removed dependency to 'ismev', 'rootsolve' (replaced with 'nleqslv' routine) and 'numDeriv'.

* Functions 'gev.mle' and 'gpd.mle' for maximum likelihood estimates of transformed parameters
* Functions 'gev.abias' and 'gpd.abias' for asymptotic bias of block maxima for fixed sample sizes or fixed thresholds
