mev v.1.12 (Release date: )
==============
New:
* Function 'rparpcs' for simulating from elliptical Pareto processes associated with max
* Exponent measure for Brown-Resnick and extremal Student model
* 'spunif' for semi-parametric transform to uniform (tail modelled using GP)
* 'rparp' now has attributes to give acceptance rate of accept/reject procedure.
* Exponent measure estimators `extcoef`
* New method for robust OBRE estimates of GP parameters
* Functions `fit.gev`,`fit.gpd`, `fit.rlarg` and `fit.pp`
* Default printing and plot optims (p-p and q-q plots) for mev_ objects
* Changes to optimization routine for pp  in `W.diag` function, use of expected information matrix, change to default tuning parameter
* Datasets

Fixes:
* scaling of Brown-Resnick is now consistent with literature (half of semivariogram)
* Incorrect degrees of freedom argument in C++ code for 'rmev' with extremal Student family
* rparp now has a hard bound to ensure the vector of simulated vectors fits in memory.
* Change to Grimshaw routine to ensure shape not less than -1, constrained optimization method
* Information matrix, score for GEV now interpolate in a neighborhood of zero to preserve continuity and avoid numerical overflow.
* Information matrix of GEV: scale factor off. All scores and information matrix have been checked and limits as xi -> 0  implemented.

Changes:
* Removed dependency to `ismev`, `rootsolve` (replaced with `nleqslv` routine) and `numDeriv`.
* Change to plot for profile log-likelihood methods
* 'smith.penult' function has new arguments (backward compatible). The quantiles `u` are now returned for Smith penultimate approximations with `method = "pot"`

==============
New:
* Function 'rparp' for simulation from R-Pareto Processes via rejection sampling
* Function 'gev.pll' and 'gpd.pll' for penalized profile likelihood and tangent exponential model approximations
* New functions 'chibar', 'angextrapo' and 'lambdadep' for bivariate and multivariate model estimation, based on work of Tawn et al.
* Dirichlet mixture smoothing for empirical angular distribution of de Carvalho et al. (2013)
* Functions 'gev.mle' and 'gpd.mle' for maximum likelihood estimates of transformed parameters
* Functions 'gev.abias' and 'gpd.abias' for asymptotic bias of block maxima for fixed sample sizes or fixed thresholds
Changes:
* Functions 'rmev', 'rmevspec', etc. now only accept variogram functions `vario` that have distance as argument
* Simulation from 'rmev' and 'rmevspec' faster to refactoring of code
* Function 'smith.penult' now has a 'family' as argument for specifying distributions via a string
* Function 'gev.tem' and 'gpd.tem' are now a wrapper for 'gev.pll' and 'gpd.pll', respectively. Routine should be more robust

* Clarifications in the vignette about the asymmetric negative logistic model (thanks to A. Stephenson)
Fixes:
* Fixed incorrect scaling in 'infomat.test' (thanks to P. Northrop)
* Model "br" now simulates from stationary version only if argument 'sigma' is provided, and otherwise samples intrinsically Gaussian processes

New:
* Added 'negdir' model to rmev

* Fixed argument matching in function `egp2`

mev v.1.9x
==============
New:
* Changes to angmeas to include different weighting if the region of interest is `max` or `min`
Changes:
* Fixed bug affecting angmeas in the bivariate case that would cause the method to crash

mev v.1.8x
==============
New:
* Bias-correction, TEM added
* Penultimate approximations (Papastathopoulos & Tawn, 2013), Naveau et al. (2014) and Smith (1987)

* fixed invalid random number generation from logistic model for near-independence cases


mev v1.7 (Release date: 2016-06-07)
==============

New:
* ext.index Extremal index estimates based on interexceedance and gap times
* infomat.test Information matrix test of Suveges and Davison (2010)

mev v1.6.1 (Release date: 2016-03-15)
==============
* fixed an error in the normal sampler (affecting version 1.5 and 1.6)
All simulations of Brown-Resnick or extremal-Student were affected by the mistake

mev v1.6 (Release date: 2016-03-08)
==============

New:
*Empirical and Euclidean likelihood estimation of spectral measure
Changes:
*gp.fit ample changes to the function, in particular a fix for the printing method, handling of errors and inclusion of the Zhang (2010) method and MCMC algorithm for the latter. This function is still preliminary and may updated in the nearby future to include further possibilities.

mev v1.5 (Release date: 2016-02-16)
==============

New:
* Wadsworth (2015) Technometrics's proposal for threshold selection based on NHPP superposition
