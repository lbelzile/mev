\title{Threshold selection diagnostic of Suveges and Davison}
\usage{
thselect.sdinfo(xdat, thresh, quantile, plot = FALSE, kmax)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdat}{[vector] vector of observations}

\item{thresh}{[vector] candidate thresholds}

\item{quantile}{[vector] probability levels to define threshold if \code{thresh} is missing.}

\item{plot}{[logical]; should the graphical diagnostic be plotted?}

\item{kmax}{[int] the largest K-gap under consideration for clusters}
}
\value{

}
\description{
The information matrix test (IMT), proposed by Suveges and Davison (2010), is based
on the difference between the expected quadratic score and the second derivative of
the log-likelihood. The asymptotic distribution for each threshold \code{u} and gap \code{K}
is asymptotically \eqn{\chi^2}{chi-square} with one degree of freedom. The approximation is good for
\eqn{N>80} and conservative for smaller sample sizes. The test assumes independence between gaps.
}
\details{
The procedure proposed in Suveges & Davison (2010) was corrected for erratas.
The maximum likelihood is based on the limiting mixture distribution of
the intervals between exceedances (an exponential with a point mass at zero).
The condition \eqn{D^{(K)}(u_n)}{D^K(u)} should be checked by the user.

Fukutome et al. (2015) propose an ad hoc automated procedure
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the interexceedance times for each K-gap and each threshold, along with the number of clusters
\item  Select the (\code{u}, \code{K}) pairs for which IMT < 0.05 (corresponding to a P-value of 0.82)
\item Among those, select the pair (\code{u}, \code{K}) for which the number of clusters is the largest
