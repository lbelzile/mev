\description{
Adaptation of Varty et al.'s metric-based threshold
automated diagnostic for the  independent and identically distributed case with no rounding.
}
\details{
The algorithm proceeds by first computing the maximum
likelihood algorithm and then simulating datasets from
replication with parameters drawn from a bivariate normal
approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator distribution.

For each bootstrap sample, we refit the
 model and convert the quantiles to
 exponential or uniform variates.
The mean absolute or mean squared distance
is calculated on these. The threshold
returned is the one with the lowest value
of the metric.
