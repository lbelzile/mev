\description{
Daily cumulated rainfall (in mm) at Maiquetia airport, Venezuela.
The observations cover the period from January 1961 to December 1999.
The original series had missing days in February 1996 (during which there were
2 days with 1hr each of light rain) and January 1998 (no rain). These were replaced by zeros.
