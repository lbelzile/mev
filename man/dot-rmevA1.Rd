\title{Multivariate extreme value distribution sampling algorithm
corresponding to Algorithm 1 in Dombry, Engelke and Oesting (2016),
using the formulation of the Dirichlet mixture of Coles and Tawn (1991)
as described and derived in Boldi (2009) for the bilogistic and extremal
Dirichlet model. Models currently implemented include logistic, negative
logistic, extremal Dirichlet and bilogistic MEV.}
\usage{
.rmevA1(n, d, para, model, Sigma, loc)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size}

\item{d}{dimension of the multivariate distribution}

\item{model}{integer, currently ranging from 1 to 9, corresponding respectively to
(1) \code{log}, (2) \code{neglog}, (3) \code{dirmix}, (4) \code{bilog},
(5) \code{extstud}, (6) \code{br}, (7) \code{ct} and \code{sdir}, (8) \code{smith} and (9) \code{hr}.}

\item{Sigma}{covariance matrix for Brown-Resnick, Smith and extremal student. Conditionally negative definite
matrix of parameters for the Huesler--Reiss model. Default matrix for compatibility}

\item{loc}{matrix of location for Smith model.}

\item{param}{a vector of parameters}
}
\value{
a \code{n} by \code{d} matrix containing the sample
