\title{Mean residual life plot}
\usage{
tstab.mrl(
  xdat,
  thresh,
  kmin = 10L,
  kmax = length(xdat),
  plot = TRUE,
  level = 0.95,
  xlab = c("thresh", "nexc"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdat}{vector of sample observations}

\item{thresh}{vector of thresholds}

\item{kmin}{integer giving the minimum number of exceedances; ignored if \code{thresh} is provided. Default to 10}

\item{kmax}{integer giving the maximum number of exceedances; ignored if \code{thresh} is provided. Default to sample size.}

\item{plot}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, call the plot method}

\item{level}{double giving the level of confidence intervals for the plot, default to 0.95}

\item{xlab}{string indicating whether to use thresholds (\code{thresh}) or number of largest order statistics (\code{nexc}) for the x-axis}

\item{...}{additional arguments, currently ignored}
}
\value{
an invisible list with mean sample exceedances and standard deviation, number of exceedances, threshold
}
\description{
Computes mean of sample exceedances over a range of thresholds or for a prespecified number of largest order statistics, and returns a plot with 95% Wald-based confidence intervals as a function of either the threshold or the number of exceedances. The main purpose is the plotting method, which generates the so-called mean residual life plot. The latter should be approximately linear over the threshold for a generalized Pareto distribution

\examples{
tstab.mrl(
 xdat = rgp(n = 100, shape = -0.5),
 xlab = "thresh",
 kmax = 50)
