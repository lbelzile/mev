}
\value{
an invisible list of matrices containing
\itemize{
\item \code{IMT} a matrix of test statistics
\item \code{pvals} a matrix of approximate p-values (corresponding to probabilities under a \eqn{\chi^2_1}{chis-square(1)} distribution)
\item \code{mle} a matrix of maximum likelihood estimates for each given pair (\code{u}, \code{K})
\item \code{loglik} a matrix of log-likelihood values at MLE for each given pair (\code{u}, \code{K})
\item \code{threshold} a vector of thresholds based on empirical quantiles at supplied levels.
\item \code{q} the vector \code{q} supplied by the user

\description{
The Information Matrix Test (IMT), proposed by Suveges and Davison (2010) based on White (1982), is based
on the difference between the expected quadratic score and the second derivative of
the log-likelihood. The asymptotic distribution for each threshold \code{u} and gap \code{K}
is asymptotically \eqn{\chi^2}{chi-square} with one degree of freedom. The approximation is good for
\eqn{N >80} and conservative for smaller sample sizes. The test assumes independence between gaps.
}
\details{
The procedure proposed in Suveges & Davison (2010) was corrected for erratas.
The maximum likelihood is based on the limiting mixture distribution of
the intervals between exceedances (an exponential with a point mass at zero).
The condition \eqn{D^{(K)}(u_n)}{D^K(u)} should be checked by the user.

Fukutome et al. (2015) propose an ad hoc automated procedure
\enumerate{
\item Calculate the interexceedance times for each K-gap and each threshold, along with the number of clusters
\item  Select the (\code{u}, \code{K}) pairs for which IMT <0.05 (corresponding to a P-value of 0.82)
\item Among those, select the pair (\code{u}, \code{K}) for which the number of clusters is the largest
