\title{Bivariate angular function for extrapolation based on rays}
\usage{
angextrapo(dat, qu = 0.95, w = seq(0.05, 0.95, length = 20))
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{an \eqn{n} by \eqn{2} matrix of multivariate observations}

\item{qu}{quantile level on uniform scale at which to threshold data. Default to 0.95}

\item{w}{vector of unique angles between 0 and 1 at which to evaluate scale empirically.}
}
\value{
a list with elements
\itemize{
\item \code{w}: angles between zero and one
\item \code{g}: scale function at a given value of \code{w}
\item \code{eta}: Ledford and Tawn tail dependence coefficient
}
}
\description{
The scale parameter \eqn{g(w)} in the Ledford and Tawn approach is estimated empirically for
\eqn{x} large as \deqn{\frac{\Pr(X_P>xw, Y_P>x(1-w))}{\Pr(X_P>x, Y_P>x)}}
where the sample (\eqn{X_P, Y_P}) are observations on a common unit Pareto scale.
 The coefficient \eqn{\eta} is estimated using maximum likelihood as the
 shape parameter of a generalized Pareto distribution on \eqn{\min(X_P, Y_P)}.
